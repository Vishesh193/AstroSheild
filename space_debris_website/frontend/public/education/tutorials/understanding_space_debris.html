    <h1>Understanding Space Debris</h1>
    
    <p>
        Space debris, also known as space junk or space waste, consists of defunct human-made objects orbiting Earth. 
        These objects include old satellites, spent rocket stages, and fragments from disintegration, erosion, and collisions.
    </p>

    <h2>The Growing Problem</h2>
    
    <p>
        As of 2023, there are over 36,500 pieces of trackable debris (objects larger than 10 cm) in Earth's orbit, 
        with millions of smaller pieces too small to track but still dangerous. This debris travels at speeds of up 
        to 28,000 km/h, making even tiny fragments potentially catastrophic if they collide with operational spacecraft.
    </p>
    
    <div class="danger-box">
        <strong>Danger:</strong> A 1 cm paint fleck traveling at orbital velocity carries the kinetic energy equivalent to 
        a hand grenade explosion. A collision with a 10 cm object could lead to catastrophic breakup of a satellite or spacecraft.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Sources of Space Debris</h2>
    
    <p>The main sources of space debris include:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Defunct Satellites:</strong> Satellites that have reached the end of their operational life and haven't been properly deorbited.</li>
        <li><strong>Spent Rocket Stages:</strong> Upper stages of launch vehicles that remain in orbit after delivering their payload.</li>
        <li><strong>Mission-Related Debris:</strong> Objects released during normal satellite deployment and operation.</li>
        <li><strong>Fragmentation Debris:</strong> Pieces created when larger objects break up, either from explosions or collisions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Significant Debris-Creating Events</h2>
    
    <p>Several events have significantly increased the amount of space debris:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2007 Chinese ASAT Test:</strong> Created over 3,000 trackable fragments when China destroyed its Fengyun-1C weather satellite.</li>
        <li><strong>2009 Iridium-Cosmos Collision:</strong> The first major collision between two intact satellites, creating approximately 2,000 trackable pieces.</li>
        <li><strong>2021 Russian ASAT Test:</strong> Russia destroyed its Cosmos 1408 satellite, creating over 1,500 trackable fragments.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Kessler Syndrome</h2>
    
    <p>
        The Kessler Syndrome, proposed by NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler in 1978, describes a scenario where the density 
        of objects in low Earth orbit becomes high enough that collisions could cause a cascade of collisions. This chain 
        reaction could create an exponentially growing cloud of debris that would make space activities and the use of 
        satellites in specific orbital ranges impractical for generations.
    </p>
    
    <div class="info-box">
        <strong>Fact:</strong> Some scientists believe we may have already reached the early stages of the Kessler Syndrome 
        in certain orbital regions, particularly in the 750-800 km altitude range.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Tracking and Monitoring</h2>
    
    <p>
        Agencies like the U.S. Space Surveillance Network continuously track space debris. They maintain a catalog of 
        known objects and provide conjunction analysis and collision warnings to satellite operators. However, current 
        technology can only reliably track objects larger than about 10 cm in low Earth orbit and 1 meter in geostationary orbit.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Mitigation Strategies</h2>
    
    <p>International guidelines for mitigating space debris include:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>End-of-Life Disposal:</strong> Moving defunct satellites to graveyard orbits or deorbiting them.</li>
        <li><strong>Passivation:</strong> Removing all stored energy (fuel, batteries) to prevent explosions.</li>
        <li><strong>Design Improvements:</strong> Creating satellites that generate less debris and are easier to deorbit.</li>
        <li><strong>Collision Avoidance:</strong> Performing maneuvers to avoid potential collisions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Future Technologies for Debris Removal</h2>
    
    <p>Several technologies are being developed to actively remove space debris:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Harpoons and Nets:</strong> To capture and control uncooperative objects.</li>
        <li><strong>Robotic Arms:</strong> For controlled capture of larger objects.</li>
        <li><strong>Laser Systems:</strong> To alter the orbit of smaller debris pieces.</li>
        <li><strong>Drag Sails and Electrodynamic Tethers:</strong> To accelerate orbital decay.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        Understanding space debris, tracking it, and developing mitigation and removal strategies are crucial for the 
        sustainable use of space and the protection of valuable space assets that modern society depends on.
